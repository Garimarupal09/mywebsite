      <h2 style="font-size: 2.0rem; color: #4b3d2a; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Hello, I’m the voice behind the blog!</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 1rem;">I am an amateur writer trying to navigate life by putting my thoughts into words. I’m still learning what it means to bare my soul in writing—to be vulnerable. As Oscar Wilde said, 'All art is quite useless.' My aim is to reach that level, where my creations could be called just that.</pp>
      <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 1rem;">I write fiction that feels like nonfiction from my life, along with poetry and essays. This space is a reflection of me—not like a mirror, but like water, where the image may be distorted but never artificial.
