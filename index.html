        <h2 style="color: #7e481c;">I wave Goodbye to the end of Beginning</h2>
       
        <p class="index_para"><q>And when I’m back in Chicago, I feel it—another version of me, I was in it.</q>— Djo, End of Beginning</p>
        <p class="index_para">The song invokes a feeling that is both painful and relatable - the realization that one day, you might return to the place you once called home—but you can never return to the person you were there. The song captures that bittersweet collision with a former self - now just a ghost preserved in memory. Similarly, in the movie Manchester by the Sea, Lee Chandler’s homecoming becomes a mirror held up to his broken soul, the same streets he grew up in now reflects back a stranger. In both works, we witness the quiet tragedy of emotional migration, where the heart leaves soon after the body does.</p>
        <p class="index_para">Migration is associated with new established distances and changed pin codes. But it is about silent departure from a familiar emotional territory, leaving behind versions of ourselves and our relationships. As Nowicka mentioned in her article- <q>This phenomenon encompasses what might be termed 'emotional migration' - the gradual disengagement from one's affective environment, resulting in the estrangement not merely from physical spaces, but from prior subjectivities and relational configurations”.</q></p>
        <p class="index_para left-border-box tagesschrift-regular" >Leaving home marks, a quiet emotional shift that reshapes our identity, changes familial bonds, and often leads to dangerous psychological disconnection—deeper than we are taught to expect.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #65350f;">Emotional Migration Reshapes Identity and Sense of Belonging </h2>
        <div class="inline-container">
          <figure class="figure-container index_para">
            <img src="img/poemimg.jpg" alt="" >
            <figcaption class="caption">Fig 1: Handwritten poem</figcaption>
          </figure>
        <span>
        <p class="index_para">Thinking we can leave and return unchanged is a sentimental delusion. Reality is that time and distance don’t freeze us in place, we grow, we adapt. And when we return, we realize, with a slow, sinking clarity - that we no longer fit where we once did. This isn’t just poetic musing. Studies on returnees show that over 70% report feeling like outsiders in their own hometowns (Global Migration Report, 2022)</p>
        <p class="index_para">My poem "HOME" traces this disintegration -</p>
        <p class="index_para"><i><b>I thought home was materialistic <br>That it was made of concrete and bricks <br>Now I stand amidst shamble of galleries <br> Wondering, is this what my home used to be.</i></b></p>
        <p class="index_para">Initially, there is a belief that home is simply a structure of concrete and bricks. Later, there’s a dawning realization: home is so much more than walls, It is emotional, living in the echoes of laughter, the resonance of love, the comfort of presence. When these are gone, the physical structure remains, but it feels soulless and empty. That’s the cruel paradox of migration: it forces growth but demands loss.</p>
        </span>
        </div>

        <h2 style="color: #5d2c04;">Migration Transforms Family Bonds in Unspoken Ways</h2>
        <p class="index_para">The second migration happens within relationships. Love persists, but the unspoken language of cohabitation - those thousand tiny references, rhythms, and rituals that constitute true intimacy – fades away with time.</p>
        <figure class="index_para">
          <iframe class="index_para" width="960" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OVzqzNzPGM4?si=n0kvmhmKlrM8JAPT" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          <figcaption class="caption">Video 1: Beginning of the movie</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="index_para">Manchester by the Sea portrays this rupture movingly. In the beginning of the film, we see Patrick and Lee fishing and roughhousing on the boat, their relationship shows comfort and familiarity. Years later when Lee returns home, they find it difficult to even hold a conversation and in the last scene, they are on the same boat, at the exact same spot but now there is silence and a struggle to stay together. Their interactions are fragmented, not for lack of affection, but because too much time and pain have changed them.</p>
        <figure class="index_para">
          <iframe class="index_para" width="960" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SBurag4oeyk?si=artLg9DJ4_5rWe4U&amp;start=726&&end=729" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          <figcaption>Video 2: Ending of the movie</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="index_para">Emotional migration does not announce itself with grand goodbyes. It trickles in quietly, leaving bonds strained—not broken, but fundamentally altered.</p>


        <h2 style="color: #632a0d;">Disconnection from Home Has Psychological Consequences</h2>
        <p class="index_para">Society applauds leaving home as a rite of passage, a necessary step toward independence.</p>
        <figure class="index_para">
          <img src="img/simg.jpg" alt="">
          <figcaption>Fig 2: Infographic of Suicide data</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="index_para">The data paints a disturbing picture. In India—a nation undergoing rapid urbanization and youth migration—suicide rates peak among those aged 15-29 (38 deaths per 100,000), with emotional isolation and family estrangement cited as leading factors (National Crime Records Bureau, 2009). Nearly <b>1 in 4 youth suicides</b> stem from fractured family ties—a statistic that exposes the dark underbelly of glorified detachment</p>

          <figure class="img_redit index_para">

        </div>
        <p class="index_para">In Reddit posts, young individuals describe visiting family only to feel like strangers, or admitting, "I don't know where to go anymore." One user writes, "I went to college and changed too much for them. I'm practically among strangers." Other laments feeling lost at family gatherings, unable to connect across generations. This isn't mere nostalgia. It's <b>psychological whiplash</b>—the trauma of being caught between worlds. Neuroscience confirms what migrants intuit: our brains map belonging through consistent emotional patterns. When those patterns rupture without replacement, we don't simply "adapt"—we grieve. (Lieberman, 2013)</p>
        <p class="index_para left-border-box tagesschrift-regular">Human beings are wired for connection—it’s not preference, but necessity. Rising suicide rates and wrenching testimonies of isolation prove a simple truth: uprootedness breeds despair. This isn’t about distance travelled, but safety loss.</p>   

        <h2 style="color: #3a1e08;">Isn't Leaving Home Essential for Growth?</h2>  
        <p class="index_para">It is true that discomfort fosters growth. We cannot always cling to the safety of our childhood home. Independence demands a willingness to step into unknown. But this argument rests on a dangerous fallacy: growth requires emotional severance.</p> 
        <p class="index_para">It doesn’t.</p>
        <p class="index_para">Studies on transnational families (Mazzucato & Schans, 2011) prove that those who maintain emotional anchors while adapting to new environments show higher long-term well-being than those who cut ties to move forward.</p>
        <p class="index_para">The real work is <b>Evolving without erasing yourself</b>. Learning to carry your roots without being trapped by them</p>

        <h2 style="color: #2c1503;">Not Everyone Who Leaves Is Broken</h2>
        <figure class="index_para">
          <img class="index_para" src="img/compass.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <figcaption>Fig 4: Belonging compass </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="index_para">Migration can be reinvention. Of course, not all who leave are devasted, many flourish and find liberation in new beginnings.</p>
        <p class="index_para">But this doesn’t negate those who ache in the silence between "where I’m from" and "who I’ve become." Both truths can coexist: the emancipated and the estranged.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #321709;">Belonging can transcend soil</h2>
        <figure class="index_para">
          <img class="index_para" src="img/home.jpg" alt="">
          <figcaption>Fig 5: Cracks in the words and the fading colors say what the heart cannot</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="index_para">Migration is a stepping stone to opportunity. Yet, as Djo and Manchester by the Sea remind us, it is also a slow, painful goodbye - to places, to people, and to parts of ourselves.</p>
        <p class="index_para">Home is not an address. It’s the way your mother’s laugh echoed in the hallway, the unspoken rules of the dinner table, the shadows casted by setting sun on the walls at 5pm. Take these away, and what’s left? Brick and mortar.</p>
        <p class="index_para">Belonging can transcend soil. It lives in the friend who still calls you by your childhood nickname, in the recipe you stubbornly keep making wrong because it’s how your grandmother did it, in the song that instantly floods you with a sense of before.</p>
        <p class="index_para">Some goodbyes are indeed forever. But belonging? That’s a story we get to keep writing.</p>
